Topic Modeling of Documents

Everyday large amounts of data is being generated. As a result, it becomes difficult to access what we are looking for. So, a tool that can label documents can be helpful for the users to get some insights about the content of the article before reading it.

This project aims to develop a topic modeling system that tags keywords to input documents using NLP techniques and machine learning. The system returns all the keywords associated with the document.

Technology used: python, pandas, scikit-learn, gensim
